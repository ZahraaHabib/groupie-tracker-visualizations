# Groupie Trackers

## Objectives
Groupie Trackers involves receiving a given API and manipulating the data contained in it to create a site that displays the information. The goal is to build a user-friendly website that displays bands' information through various data visualizations.

## API Overview
The given API consists of four parts:
1. **Artists**: Contains information about bands and artists such as their names, images, the year they began their activity, the date of their first album, and their members.
2. **Locations**: Lists their last and/or upcoming concert locations.
3. **Dates**: Contains their last and/or upcoming concert dates.
4. **Relation**: Links all other partsâ€”artists, dates, and locations.

## Requirements
- **Backend**: Must be written in Go.
- **Site Reliability**: The site and server must not crash at any time.
- **Error Handling**: All pages must work correctly, and any errors must be handled properly.
- **Code Quality**: The code must follow good practices.
- **Testing**: It is recommended to have test files for unit testing.

## Event/Action
Create an event/action that triggers an action known as a client call to the server (client-server). This action must communicate with the server to receive information, following the request-response model. The event/action should respond to some kind of action triggered by the client, time, or any other factor.

## Data Visualizations
You can display the bands' information through various data visualizations such as:
- Blocks
- Cards
- Tables
- Lists
- Pages
- Graphics

## Learning Outcomes
This project will help you learn about:
- Manipulation and storage of data
- JSON files and format
- HTML
- Event creation and display
- Client-server model

## Instructions
1. **Backend**: Implement the backend in Go.
2. **Error Handling**: Ensure all pages handle errors correctly.
3. **Code Practices**: Adhere to good coding practices.
4. **Testing**: Include unit tests for your code.

## Allowed Packages
Only the standard Go packages are allowed.

## Usage
You can see an example of a RESTful API [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Request%E2%80%93response).
